''' Python Variables '''
num1 = 6 #Declaring and Initialising num1
num2 = 7 #Declaring and Initialising num2
sum = num1 + num2
print(sum)
int myVariable = 6;

x = 5 # x is of type integer
y = "Avinash" # y is of type String
c = 'a'
z = 8.59 # z is of float type

Casting : Casting is basically converting our datatype to any type whatever you want.

p = str(3)
q = int(5)
floatVar = float(x)
intVar = int(z)
print(m) # ord() and chr() --> Functions to change into ascii and int
print(intVar)
variableName (CamelCasing Rule) (Type Convention)

print(floatVar)

# WAP to print the simple interest
p, r, t = 5, 5, 5 # p is the principal amt in int dataType
print("The simple interest is:" + (p*r*t)/100)

myVar  = "John"
my_Var = "John"
MY_VAR = "John"

# These variable names are against the rules of identifiers
2myVar = "john"
my-var = "john"
my var = "john"

'''Naming Conventions of variables, methods'''
# myVariable       --> camelCase
# MyVariable       --> PascalCase
# my_variable_name --> snakecase

''' Assign Multiple values in my variable in different lines '''
p = 5
q = 7
r = 9
print(p)
print(q)
print(r)

''' Assign Multiple values in my variable in same line'''
x, y, z = "kartik,", "Abhishek,", "Prerita" # assigning multiple
print(x,y,z)

''' list is used for storing multiple valuess''' 
# unpack a list
names = ["kartik", "Abhishek", "Prerita"]
